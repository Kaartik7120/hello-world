int main()
    {
        std::cout<<"hello world\n";// \n is used to break the line just like System.out.println in java , we can also use <<endl to break the line (it has same function as \n and System.out.println)
        std::cout<<"My first program\n";
        return 0;// tells that the program has come to an end

    }
